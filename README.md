# Chromatico
Final project from Launchcode's Summer of Code, done in Python 2/3.
This is a website where users can train their ears in order to develop better tonal memory and recognition of musical notation, to improve relative pitch- if not perfect pitch.

The title is a reference to the Chromatic scale on which all 12 of music's pitches lie.
